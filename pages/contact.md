## Github issues

If you have an idea for a feature to add or an approach for a bugfix, it is best to communicate with AskOmics developers early. The primary venue for this is the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/askomics/flaskomics/issues). Browse through existing GitHub issues and if one seems related, comment on it. If no existing Galaxy issue seems appropriate, a new issue can be opened using [this form](https://github.com/askomics/flaskomics/issues/new).
